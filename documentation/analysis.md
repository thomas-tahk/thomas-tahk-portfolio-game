# Project Analysis: Current vs Reference Implementation

## What You Have ✅

### Core Game Infrastructure
- ✅ `initGame.js` - Game initialization with proper sprite loading, fonts, logos
- ✅ `kaplayCtx.js` - Kaplay context setup
- ✅ `Player.js` - Complete player entity with movement and animations
- ✅ `constants.js` - Color palette and game constants
- ✅ `store.js` - Jotai state management for modals and camera
- ✅ `ReactUI.jsx` - Basic UI wrapper
- ✅ React modals: `EmailModal.jsx`, `ProjectModal.jsx`, `SocialModal.jsx`
- ✅ `CameraController.jsx` - Camera control component
- ✅ `Section.js` - Basic section component (makeSection function)

### Assets Structure
- ✅ Fonts, logos, sprites, shaders properly organized
- ✅ Player sprite with 8-directional animations
- ✅ Logo assets for various technologies
- ✅ Fragment shader for tiled background pattern

## What's Missing ❌

### Core Game Components (from reference)
- ❌ `EmailIcon.js` - Individual email icon component
- ❌ `Icon.js` - Generic icon component
- ❌ `ProjectCard.js` - Project display cards
- ❌ `SkillIcon.js` - Skill/technology icons
- ❌ `SocialIcon.js` - Social media icons
- ❌ `WorkExperienceCard.js` - Work experience display

### Game World & Interactables
- ❌ Actual game sections/areas to explore
- ❌ Interactive objects and collision detection with sections
- ❌ Skills showcase area
- ❌ Projects showcase area
- ❌ Work experience area
- ❌ Contact/social media area

### Missing Assets
- ❌ `youtube-logo.png`, `x-logo.png`, `substack-logo.png`, `email-logo.png`
- ❌ Project images/screenshots
- ❌ Configuration files in `/public/configs/`

### Integration Issues
- ❌ Sections not instantiated in `initGame.js` (line 95 commented out)
- ❌ Modal integration with game world interactions
- ❌ Content population (personal info, projects, experience)

## Key Functional Gaps

1. **Game World Layout**: No defined areas/sections for different portfolio content
2. **Interactivity**: Player can move but has nothing to interact with
3. **Content**: No actual portfolio content (projects, skills, experience)
4. **Navigation**: No clear way to access different portfolio sections
5. **Integration**: Modals exist but aren't triggered by game interactions
