# Thomas Tahk Portfolio Game - Claude Documentation

## Project Overview
This is a portfolio website presented as a simplified 2D game, inspired by JSLegendDev's work. The project serves as a starting point for building a unique, interactive portfolio experience.

## Current Status
- ✅ Functional 2D game with player movement (WASD + arrow keys + mouse/touch)
- ✅ Game sections with collision detection working
- ✅ Proper zoom level for good overview
- ✅ React modal system in place (Email, Project, Social)
- ✅ Social modals fully functional with collision detection and auto-close
- ✅ Interactive Skills section with physics-enabled tech logos
- ✅ Asset structure and game engine setup complete
- ✅ Golden orange sections that contrast well with background

## Goals
1. ✅ Complete basic portfolio game functionality
2. Add more game sections (Projects, Skills, Contact)
3. Connect sections to existing modals
4. Personalize with Thomas's details/info
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
6. Future expansion and iteration beyond the initial inspiration

## Development Notes
- **Latest Status**: Interactive social and skills sections fully functional
- **Recent Progress**: 
  - ✅ Social modals working with collision detection and auto-close on exit
  - ✅ Interactive Skills section with physics-enabled tech stack logos
  - ✅ Tech logos spawn on Skills exit, reset on re-entry, can be pushed/kicked around
  - ✅ Fixed social modal bugs (className typo, atom imports, collision handlers)
  - ✅ Complete social section implementation with intro text, logos, labels, and interactive circles
  - ✅ Fixed modal positioning with CSS transform offset workaround (-20vw, -21.5vh)
  - ✅ Fixed text outlines using layered text approach (background + foreground)
  - ✅ Created Skills, Experience, and Gmail modals with placeholder content
  - ✅ Converted entire layout from fixed pixels to responsive percentage-based positioning
  - ✅ Implemented idle-triggered controls message (appears after 5 seconds)
  - ✅ Applied consistent darker orange color (#d35400) to all interactive elements
  - ✅ Fine-tuned vertical spacing to prevent modal trigger overlaps
- **Technical Notes**: 
  - **Responsive Layout**: All positioning uses `k.width()` and `k.height()` percentages for cross-device compatibility
  - **Social Section**: Spans from 85% to 55% above center (intro → logos → labels → circles)
  - **Player Position**: Spawns at 40% above center, properly spaced from social circles and About section
  - **Portfolio Sections**: About at 15% above, Skills/Experience at 10% below, Projects at 35% below center
  - **Modal System**: CSS offset workaround applied to center modals properly
  - **Text Effects**: Shadow/outline effects achieved through layered text elements

## Next Steps
- [x] **Add collision detection for social circles** to trigger confirmation modals
- [x] **Create external link confirmation modals** for GitHub, LinkedIn, Gmail
- [x] **Add interactive skill logos** as kickable elements
- [ ] **Set up GitHub Pages deployment** ⭐ NEXT SESSION FOCUS
- [ ] **Populate modals with actual content** (replace placeholder text and data)
- [ ] **Fine-tune responsive scaling** for mobile devices if needed

## Ready for Deployment
The core functionality is complete and ready for deployment:
- Social modals work with real links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Gmail)
- Interactive Skills section with physics-enabled tech logos
- All portfolio sections functional with modal system
- Game mechanics and UI fully operational

**Next session should focus on GitHub Pages deployment setup.**

## Session Notes
- **Documentation Policy**: Claude will update this file with progress after each meaningful session
- **Testing Preference**: User prefers to run `npm run dev` themselves in a separate terminal to observe, analyze, and give feedback. Claude should NOT run the dev server directly.
- **Known Issues**: Kaplay coordinate system has unexplained offset - using workaround rather than root cause fix
